# jwt-bch-lib Example

This example shows how to use the [jwt-bch-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-bch-lib) npm JavaScript library to automatically retrieve a JWT token and instantiate bch-js with it. This can be used to keep your app working continuously. All you should have to worry about is keeping a credit in your FullStack.cash account, and this library will allow your app to automatically retrieve a new JWT token when the old one expires.

The example in this repository is the same thing as [this bch-jwt-demo repository](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/jwt-bch-demo).
